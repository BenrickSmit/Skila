# GeneralCXXTemplate
A basic C++ Project template file structure created to help me with sideprojects. It allows the easy creation of libraries, profiling information, tests, and more.

# Description
This is a general C++ template project structure. It comes with automated
documentation, automated testing (using gtest), automated profiling (using gprof) and CMake
to help with the execution.


<code>init_documentation.sh</code> is used to create the documentation automatically
<code>run_all.sh</code> is used to run all tests and program execution, as well as to create the necessary documentation and profile information
<code>run_application.sh</code> is used to run only the application
<code>run_tests.sh</code> is used to run only the tests
<code>run_profile.sh</code> is used to run only the profiler

<code>build_info</code> contains the build_name, build_version, and build_cxx_standard text files.
<code>build_name</code> contains the project name. 
<code>build_version</code> contains the project version number. 
<code>build_cxx_standard</code> contains the CXX standard used, it's default is 11
